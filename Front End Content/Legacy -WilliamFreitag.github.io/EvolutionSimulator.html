      <h1>Evolution Simulation</h1>
      <div>This project is a desktop application called "Evolution Simulation." It is a program which simulates a population of organisms and demonstrates evolution through
           survival of the fittest as the organisms race each other to pick up food.</div>
      <div>Evolution Simulation is a java program which uses JavaFX to create a graphical representation of the simulation which runs at 60 frames per second.
           The program also makes use of linked lists to store the data associated with the potentially infinitely expanding population of organisms.</div>
