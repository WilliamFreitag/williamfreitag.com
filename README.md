# williamfreitag.com
williamfreitag.com is a website built and hosted by me. It serves as a place to display my projects.

This website itself has been one of my main projects. It is a nodejs application which runs 24/7 on a linux machine. The machine is connected to my home network and everything has been configured such that it can be reached using williamf.mynetgear.com:81. The domain williamfreitag.com redirects to williamf.mynetgear.com:81 and that is what I intend users to use. The machine consumes approximately $1 of electricity per month, which is acceptable for me. In the future I plan to implement more functionality such as a mail server or a dns resolver. This project has allowed me to learn about the internet and full stack web development and I am exited to expand on it.
